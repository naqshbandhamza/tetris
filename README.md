all of these files are to be pasted where you keep your .cpp files in a visual studio c++ project
in order to run this program first of all you must donwload sfml on your computer.
then include the files game.h , character.h as header files and Source.cpp, game.cpp and character.cpp in the cpp files section
top in the menu bar select properties and then select your project properties at the bottom
select C/C++ , select general paste "C:\SFML-2.5.1\include" against the additional include directories, then apply (this is the path of the location where sfml is installed in C by defualt)
comeout and now select linker, select general against additional library directories paste "C:\SFML-2.5.1\lib" then apply
now try to run the program ,it runs GOOD!!!
else check again in project properties select your platform for mine it was x64.
